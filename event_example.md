Summary: First Hackathon guys!

This is our super cool new hackathon that we shall be organising, hooray look how cool it is.

Date should be set to the date of the event not to the date of writing the post.

The category should be one of Hacks, Talks, Workshops. This list may expand in future, and if so is likely to be documented in the README.

The summary will be displayed on the home page, so get the most important bits in there and expand in the section that follows.

Don't forget to include sponsor sections and equipment lists that people should bring.
