EaRS is pleased to announce that we will be running the IoT Challenge this year!

Are you interested in coding, electronics or the Internet of Things?

The IoT Challenge is a 3 day making challenge where you will get put into teams, be given some equipment and build something cool! Whatever your experience level, (even if youâ€™re completely new!) come along and learn some new things in a fun, relaxed environment. We will have workshops and mentors throughout the event, so you will receive all the support you need to make something you can be proud of.

If you have any questions do not hesitate to ask. Drop us a Facebook message or send us an email.
