EaRS is excited to invite all of you to an all new workshop with Marty the Robot!

Come along and work in teams to teach Marty how to kick a ball! The workshop will cover some of the basics of ROS and some computer vision concepts. You will learn how to make your robot identify and follow the ball using a Raspberry Pi and Pi Camera! Along the way we will be helped and guided by Robotical's CEO, Sandy Enoch.

Difficulty level: 3/10: This workshop will have a couple of tricky concepts, but is also open to beginners. Previous knowledge of Python and the Raspberry Pi will be helpful, but feel free to come along without any previous experience.

This is a ticketed event. Make sure to get the tickets quickly as they will sell out fast!

Hope to see you all on Monday!
