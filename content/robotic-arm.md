Summary: EaRS's main Welcome Week event 2017!
Slug: robotic-arm

Build your own robotic arm with the Embedded and Robotics Society!

We will teach you how to make your very own robot from scratch using only household materials. During the workshop you will put together a hydraulic arm that can pick up and move objects. You'll even have the opportunity to take it home with you!

The event will take place in the Central Library in UCreate Studio on the first floor. Come join us for a fun afternoon of creating and making!

PLEASE NOTE: This event will run in two identical sessions 2pm - 4pm and 4pm to 6pm. You can book on either, but please get a ticket for the correct session as we have limited space.
