Slug: elec-workshop-s1-2017

The University of Edinburgh Embedded and Robotics Society (EaRS) is excited to announce our first event of the semester! It will be held in UCreate Studio, a fantastic new maker space, on Monday 25 September 18:00-21:00. This is a re-run of the electronics workshop we ran last semester.

Starting off with building your first circuit, we will then take you through some basic components, including how they work and what they are used for. You will learn about LEDs, resistors, capacitors and more alongside how to put together electronics and making sure it works. There will also be many opportunities to make new friends and get to know the other members of the society through fun activities and games.

Difficulty level 1/10: No prior electronics knowledge required. Basic understanding of concepts such as voltage, current, resistance will be helpful but not necessary. Everything will be explained from the basics. This event is aimed firmly at beginners, but if you are more experienced and still want to get involved, let us know (ears.edinburgh@gmail.com), we're always looking for extra mentors and expertise.

If for some reason you are no longer able to attend please make sure to let us know! We only have a limited number of spaces available and someone else would be able to make good use of your ticket.
