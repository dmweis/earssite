Summary: Our first programming workshop! Build the game of Snake on the micro:bit using the accelerometer.
Slug: microbit-snake

The University of Edinburgh Embedded and Robotics Society (EaRS) is excited to announce our first programming workshop - Snake on the BBC micro:bit! It will be held in UCreate Studio, a fantastic new makerspace, on Monday 09 October 18:00-21:00.

Starting off with basic computer science concepts we will teach you how to build an interactive Snake game controlled by tilting your micro:bit. We will take you through the development process from start to finish. You will learn game programming concepts, Python and how micro:bits interact with the outside world. At the end of the workshop you will have built your very own Snake game!

Difficulty level: 3/10: Some programming experience is useful and you may find it hard to follow the workshop if you have never programmed before. Don’t worry if you haven’t programmed before though, we’ll help you individually!

This is a ticketed event! Make sure to get your tickets early as they will sell out really quickly!
