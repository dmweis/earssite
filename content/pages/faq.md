Some questions pop up more than others. We have tried to answer the most common ones here. Have any other questions? [Contact us](/contact).

## What is embedded development? ##

Embedded development is writing code to run on devices that we don't traditionally think of as computers. A good example is writing code for smart watches, but you also find embedded software in washing machines, microwaves, IoT devices and cars. This means that you have to think about the performance and energy impact of your code more than normal. Like anything else cool, embedded development can seem really scary at first, but once you take your first few steps it will seem easier.

## What is the difference between robotics and embedded? ##

Robotics is the study of robots and everything that goes into making them. This includes the software, mechanical and electronic design and assembly. Embedded on the other hand is just the field of writing software for small processors.

## What if I'm not a student at the University of Edinburgh? ##

We welcome all people interested in embedded development and robotics, regardless of who you are or your background. You are more than welcome to come along to any of our events. You can even become a voting member if you wish to guide the direction of the society, however we are required to have 75% membership from the university so [contact us](/contact) first.

## What if I'm a beginner/new to programming/new to robotics? ##

That's great! We love new people to get into the field and a lot of the reason we were founded was to help people like yourself get past the initial learning curve. We aim to make our events beginner friendly and we will offer you all the support you need to get up and running. If you're still worried about coming along, why not work through our getting started pages? If you get stuck at any point, [let us know](/contact).

## I've been doing embedded development/robotics for a while, will I get anything out of this? ##

We aim to run lots of events that will cater to more advanced developers, to encourage people with experience to join the society. If you would like to give a talk or run a workshop we are very keen to talk to you, drop us a line [here](/contact).
