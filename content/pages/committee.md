I love learning about how things work at their core. Be it the unseen software controlling it or the moving parts and how they fit together, I am always fascinated to see how it's done. That's why embedded and robotics appealed to me. I get to see for myself how to give functionality to objects and make them respond to the real world.

I came to Edinburgh not knowing an awful lot about technology and feeling like a bit of an outcast since everyone else on my course seemed to know so much. Then I found EaRS and they gave me the chance to learn and ask questions without feeling judged. Having this opportunity helped me become much more confident in myself and has given me a love of tinkering with random pieces of tech without fear of breaking it.

I feel extremely fortunate that I am now in the position to provide this friendly, open space for others who find themselves in my shoes and help them discover the same passion for embedded software and robotics that I have.

Wassim Jabrane - **Secretary**

I'm often guilty of getting more excited about the technology behind things than the applications themselves, hence my interest lies primarily in the embedded side of the society.
<br><br>
I took last year out to work for a company that does a lot of embedded development and it was there that I first became interested in the area.
<br><br>
I'm often also found tinkering about with DSP and wireless protocols. If you have any issues, I'd love to help, so drop me a line at the [society email](mailto:ears.edinburgh@gmail.com) or my [personal email](mailto:cmacleod170@googlemail.com).

Annabel Jakob  - **Treasurer**

I like to think that no problem is too big or too hard.
<br><br>
I am particularly interested in automation and AI, but I tend to dip my toes in anything that takes my interest. The effect these technologies have on the world has always excited me; and use of modern development hardware for prototyping is easier than ever!
<br><br>
If you want to know more about anything I have done before or have any questions give me a buzz!

The infinite possibilities with technology are what draws me to this field. You can build almost anything you fancy!
<br><br>
It all started back in secondary school when I tried making an Android live wallpaper. I realized then how much fun it was not only to learn something new but also to bring what you have in your head to life.
<br><br>
I'm here to help you learn and to aid you in your first steps to creating something amazing. But I'm also here to play, so if you're up for some games, let me know!

Gagan Devagiri - **Workshop Coordinator**
-------------------------------
<img class="photo" src="/images/gagan.png" alt="Gagan"></img>
When I first joined the university I was overwhelmed with everyone's accomplishments and how much everyone around me knows and this has motivated me to learn more, everyday! Through EaRs, I'm learning about Embedded and robotics development and have learned to built cool stuff by attending the workshops myself and mentoring few of them.

When I'm not with EaRs, you can find me in Appleton Tower complaining about my coursework or playing Minecraft or if it is the weekends, I'll probably be at a hackathon attempting to build something. I'm often guilty of missing my Monday lectures because I couldn't wake up the next day after a long hackathon. You can message me on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notgagan">facebook</a> or <a href="https://instagram.com/gag_dev">Instagram</a> or email me at <a href ="mailto:gagandevagiri@gmail.com">gagandevagiri@gmail.com</a>
