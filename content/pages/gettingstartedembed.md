Title: Getting Started with Embedded Development
Slug: startembed

Embedded development is scary. At least to start with. That's why we've put together this guide to taking your first steps with it, and at the end we've put some links to help you go further. Don't forget that if at any time you need help, you can [contact us](/contact).

** What is embedded development? **

Embedded development is writing code for anything that we don't typically think of as a computer. This could be anything from a washing machine, to a watch or more recently with IoT developments, things like your light switches. Writing embedded code typically involves caring more about energy usage and performance of code than other areas in software development.

** Rest of guide coming soon. We are actively working on the site, and if you can help either [submit a pull request](https://github.com/ears-edi/earssite) or [let us know](/contact). **
