Caitlin McDougall - **President**

I will get easily excited about anything technology related.  Simple or complicated, boring or interesting; I love every single bit, however it's act of building things myself that holds a special place in my heart.
<br><br>
When I started university all I wanted to do is build cool things; hardware, software: it didn't really matter. Despite this, due to lack of confidence in my abilities and self-esteem, finding the courage to touch embedded took me a while.
<br><br>
This society is my way of helping others have fun by making their beginnings with hardware as interesting and as pleasant as possible. I want EaRS to become a community where everyone regardless of their skills can learn and share ideas.
<br><br>
If you've got any questions drop me a message either on my [personal account](mailto:aga@mcha.eu) or on the [society's](mailto:ears.edinburgh@gmail.com). Don't hesitate to ask about anything, I probably know less about Embedded and Robotics than you. Having said that, is there a better way to learn than starting a hardware oriented society? :)

Cameron MacLeod - **Secretary**

I'm often guilty of getting more excited about the technology behind things than the applications themselves, hence my interest lies primarily in the embedded side of the society.
<br><br>
I took last year out to work for a company that does a lot of embedded development and it was there that I first became interested in the area.
<br><br>
I'm often also found tinkering about with DSP and wireless protocols. If you have any issues, I'd love to help, so drop me a line at the [society email](mailto:ears.edinburgh@gmail.com) or my [personal email](mailto:cmacleod170@googlemail.com).

I like to think that no problem is too big or too hard.
<br><br>
I am particularly interested in automation and AI, but I tend to dip my toes in anything that takes my interest. The effect these technologies have on the world has always excited me; and use of modern development hardware for prototyping is easier than ever!
<br><br>
If you want to know more about anything I have done before or have any questions give me a buzz!

The infinite possibilities with technology are what draws me to this field. You can build almost anything you fancy!
<br><br>
It all started back in secondary school when I tried making an Android live wallpaper. I realized then how much fun it was not only to learn something new but also to bring what you have in your head to life.
<br><br>
I'm here to help you learn and to aid you in your first steps to creating something amazing. But I'm also here to play, so if you're up for some games, let me know!

Ami Bakhai - **Talks Coordinator**

These people above me are scary... they know so much about technology :O But I have a great interest in technology and they have made me a place among them. The motivation I have towards learning and creating something has given me the chance to build my knowledge of using different technologies. 
<br><br>
I was a complete beginner, I had never used my command line just a few years ago but now I have it open 24/7 on my laptop. I have learnt a lot especially from EaRS. But just generally from life, whether it is communication skills, marketing, hardware or software; I will not hesitate being curious about it and taking time to learn about it. 
<br><br>
I am here for you to talk to about technology or basically anything you fancy, just send me a message!
