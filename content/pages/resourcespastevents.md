## Build your own Robotic Arm! ##

** 15 September 2017 ** - [Event Page](/events/robotic-arm)

Our main Welcome Week event for 2017 saw 40 people build their own cardboard hydraulic arm. We ran two sessions in uCreate Studio that took attendees from a piece of cardboard to a fully functioning arm. It was a nice introduction to the semester and a good omen for things to come!

## Electronics Workshop - Part 1 ##

** 17 April 2017 ** - [Event Page](/events/electronics-workshop-part-1)

I think it's fair to say that EaRS has kicked off well with our first workshop. We took 18 attendees through the basics of building circuits from lighting up their first LED to understanding the difference between NPN and PNP transistors and building quite a complex circuit by the end! We also played a good few games to get people socialising and to help explain some of the more abstract concepts.

As a society, we'd have to say that our favourite bits were seeing people helping each other and witnessing the start of a community. Our attendees also really surprised us with how fast they picked up difficult concepts and built the circuits provided. Of course, that isn't to say we didn't like the chocolate and biscuits!

Even though our last event has only just passed, we're already looking to the future and the next few events that we can run. We have plenty of ideas, but would always welcome more. If you feel you have an idea or would like to help us run an event as a mentor or speaker, then [get in touch](/contact)! We could always use an extra hand. :)
